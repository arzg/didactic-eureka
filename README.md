## todo

- [ ] finish first end-to-end prototype
  - [ ] implement typechecking for initial language subset
  - [ ] implement C code generation for initial language subset
    - make sure to have underflow and overflow checks
  - [ ] vim syntax highlighting
  - [ ] vim `:make` compatible diagnostic formatting
- [ ] add enough language features to make writing useful code _possible_
  - [ ] struct field access
    - make sure to support through pointer
  - [ ] `return`, `break` and `continue`
    - donâ€™t worry about checking whether every path through a function returns
  - [ ] `bool`, `true` and `false`
  - [ ] infinite loops and while loops
  - [ ] length-prefixed slices with bounds-checked indexing
  - [ ] string literal escapes
  - [ ] struct literals
  - [ ] bitwise or, and, not, xor
  - [ ] C-like enums lowered to integers
  - [ ] `malloc` and `free` as special syntax

  - [ ] unchecked external C functions
- [ ] write some tiny demo programs to make sure everything works
- [ ] add enough language features to make writing code an alright experience
  - [ ] format strings
  - [ ] methods
  - [ ] nullable types
    - look at Zig and Hare for inspiration
  - [ ] some form of a `switch`-like construct
  - [ ] some form of unions
    - could be unchecked unions, Rust-like extended `enum`s with payloads, Hare-like anonymous tagged unions
  - [ ] enough of a generics/templates system to allow making collection types and nothing else
  - [ ] Zig-like tests
  - [ ] basic multi-file support
- [ ] self hosting
- [ ] further features ...
  - [ ] replace dedicated `malloc` and `free` syntax with Zig-like custom allocators
  - [ ] immutable variables and pointers
  - [ ] module system
  - [ ] unused warnings
  - [ ] actually check if all paths through a function return a value
